1. 1st April 2020 - Got selected as one of the top 100 performers from all over the world for the "Facebook Pytorch Scholarship Challenge" phase 2.
Also, it is fortunate to see that I am the only one selected from the USA. Thank you for your discussions and guidance. I really hope and look forward to working with you soon.

Details: In November 2019, Facebook announced its scholarship and I applied for it. I built a bot-based multiplayer game and submitted it in the application. In January 2020, Facebook selected thousands of qualified developers from all over the world in phase 1. Out of which, only the top 100 students are selected in phase 2. I am glad I am one of them, attached the mail below.
